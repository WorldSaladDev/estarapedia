					<p>Estara has four continental landmasses. Estaran maps typically center on the Mouth of Estara, a
						large undersea basin of unknown origin.</p>
					<div class="image-container">

					<h3 id="section1.1">The Mouth of Estara</h3>
					<p class="subtext">Main article: </p>
					<p>
						Storms swirl constantly in the skies above and around the Mouth, deterring sailors from
						traveling through these waters. The crater's eastern edge is lined with islands, the largest of
						which are known as the Pit Isles. The islands are surrounded in significant fields of chaotic Draihar
						Being situated on the edge of the Mouth of Estara, the Pit Isles are also subject to near-constant
						bad weather, with high winds and heavy rain.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Pit Isles are not known to have a permanent population due to the hazardous conditions, but researchers
						and thrillseekers occasionally brave the shores of these lands, usually without returning.
					</p>

					<h3 id="section1.2">Ekhala</h3>
					<p class="subtext">Main article: </p>
					<p>
						To the east of the Mouth lies Ekhala, the largest of Estara’s continents. The continent is split
						by the Kaylik mountain range, of which the Thorn of Estara – the tallest mountain on Estara – is
						part.
						The bay of Temchael is surrounded by mountains in the eastern part of the continent. The Dunes
						of
						Ekhala spans from the Kayliks to the western edge of the continent. North of the dunes is the
						Berreth Steppe,
						a plain of dry but fertile land, and north of the steppe lies the Umbreweald, an icy forest
						teeming with
						magical beasts. A series of peninsulae along the southern edge of the continent are dotted with
						large coastal cities .
						The Altueran island chain trails off from the southeastern edge of Ekhala.
					</p>
					<p>
						Climate conditions vary across Ekhala. The Dunes see very little rainfall each
						year and receive direct sunlight on most days. The Berreth Steppe sports cool
						winds unhindered by trees or mountains, accompanied by light rainfall. Further
						north, the pine forests of the Umbreweald freeze over during the harsher winters. The peninsulae
						of
						Hamshi enjoy salty sea spray and gentle winds that cool the landscape. In Temchael, the
						weather is cool, calm and temperate year round. The Altuerans are known for their warm and humid
						climate.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many settlements are spread across Ekhala, with a number of great cities. Three nations call the
						mainland home:
						Temchael in their namesake bay; the Hamshi, with their population primarily centered on the
						southern peninsulae;
						and the Tir Moran, who inhabit the northern reaches of the Berreth Steppe and the Umbreweald.
						The Altueran Islands
						are also home to a number of small nations who have a shared culture.
					</p>
					<h3 id="section1.3">Tzizen</h3>
					<p class="subtext">Main article: <a href="tzizen_article.html">Tzizen</a></p>
					<p>
						Tzizen, the smallest continent, can be found northwest of the Mouth of Estara. Most of
						its land and population lies in the Misty Valley, a valley between the two branches of the
						Tzizen Mountain range.
						On the northern end of the continent sits Da Yonjiang, Estara's largest active volcano.
						In the sea to the west, the sparsely inhabited Wa Tzizen islands protect the mainland from the
						storms of the Great Sea. North of the mainland lies the Yonjiang Islands, a volcanic island
						chain originating from the Yonjiang hotspot.
					</p>
					<p>
						The mainland of Tzizen is primarily composed of cloud forests, with cold temperatures and high
						humidity, but rarely extreme weather conditions.
						The southern tip of the continent is covered in marshland as a result of the many rivers flowing
						down from the mountain
						and down the valley. Further north, the cloud forests give way to boreal woods. The Yonjiang
						Islands are barren, cold and
						incredibly windy. The Wa Tzizen islands are characterized by lowland jungles and frequent storms
					</p>
					<p>
						The continent and surrounding islands are the domain of the Kingdom of Tzizen. The majority of
						the population live within the Misty Valley.
						A few settlements are established on the Wa Tzizen Islands, and the Yonjiang Islands are a penal
						colony with an autonomous local government.
					</p>

					<h3 id="section1.4">Anka</h3>
					<p class="subtext">Main article: </p>
					<p>
						South of Tzizen, across the Strait of Fluire, is the continent Anka. Anka's landscape is
						dominated by the Vacia desert, Estara's second largest desert. The Cubroda mountains line the
						northern and western edges of the continent.
						To the east and across the Bay of Vione
						towers the lone mountain Volare. The islands Regana and Fiori are situated west of the sea of
						Prima.
						To the south, the Melar Forest spans across the Isthmus of Melar and into
						Estica.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Vacia desert is dry and warm year round, with little rainfall. However, life flourishes
						along the rivers that run through the desert. The Melar forest recieves heavy rainfall,
						amplified by the tall canopies that capture low-flying clouds. The eastern edge of the continent
						is composed mostly of sparse forests and grasslands with moderate rainfall. The islands of
						Regana and Fiori are known for their fair and consistent weather.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anka is one of the most heavily populated continents. Vast cities cover the western coast,
						and a number
						of distinct cultures flourish in the variety of resources offered by the continent. The
						Primetira Kingdom
						holds domain over all of Anka and Estica, except Regana and Fiori, where the independent nation
						of Regana e Fiori resides.
					</p>

					<h3 id="section1.5">Estica</h3>
					<p class="subtext">Main article: </p>
					<p>
						Estica lies south of Anka. The Melar Forest thins out as it spreads south of the isthmus, giving
						way to grasslands and finally the Ala Via mountain range, named for its highest peak. The Otoros
						Islands fill the sea east of the mainland.
					</p>
					<p>
						South of the Melar Forest, Estica is composed primarily of grasslands, with moderate rain and
						fair
						temperatures that drop farther south. The continent extends into polar regions at its southern
						tip.
						The Otoros islands recieve heavy rain, and are covered in dense jungle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Estica is less populated than Anka, but the capital city of the Primetira Kingdom - also the
						largest city in Estara - is situated at the base of Ala Via. Numerous other settlements are
						spread across the continent. The Otoros islands are known to be inhabited by primitive peoples.
						Little effort has been made to contact them.

					<h2 id="section2">Culture and Politics</h2>
					<p>There are a number of cultures inhabiting Estara.</p>
					<h3 if="section2.1">Hamshi</h3>
					<p class="subtext">Main article: </p>
					<p>The Hamshi nation occupies the southern portion of Ekhala up to the Breac River. They primarily
						speak the <a href="hamshi_language_article.html">Hamshi language</a>.
					</p>
				</article>
					<hr>
					<h2 id="section3">Timekeeping</h2>
					<p>One Estaran day is equal to 24 hours. An Estaran year last 240 days. The calendar is split into
						ten months, each with three weeks lasting eight days.</p>
					<p>In many cultures across Estara, it is believed that one transitions to adulthood at the age of
						twenty-four years. The number twenty-four is of special interest because of its connection with
						the cycles of Estara and its moons.</p>
					<p>The calendar shown below is agreed upon by all major governing bodies on Estara in order to
						better facilitate trade.
						The last nation to join in adhering to this standard was Hamshi, in the sixty-second Year
						Estaran (Y.E.). 1YE falls on the year the Estaran Calendar was devised by the Primetira Kingdom.
