                        <p>Eingahr is a metal alloy with similar composition to cupronickel. It is used in the construction
                            of magical devices due to its resistance to corrosion from Draiharbloom oil compounds and magic insulating properties.</p>

                    <h2 id="section1">Composition</h2>
                    <p>Eingahr is a metal alloy typically composed of around three parts copper, one part nickel and one part zinc.
                        Throughout the forging process, magical energy is directed from the ambient field into the metal without the use of 
                        a focus or incantation. This process is believed to give the metal its magic insulating properties, as well as increase
                        its resistance to mundane corrosion. The quality of the finished material is influenced by fluctuations of energy during casting, with
                        an uninterupted, constant level of energy throughout the process yielding the best results.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="subsection1.1">Alternative Compositions</h3>
                    <p>Alternative compositions have been tested with varying results. It has been reported that a higher percentage of nickel content can 
                        increase resistance to corrosion, at the cost of reduced maleability and greater production cost.
                    </p>
                    <p>The properties and qualities of Eingahr can vary slightly depending on where it was forged and where the materials were sources. It is 
                        speculated that variations in the ambient field at different locations can affect the outcome of the forging process.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="section2">Properties</h2>
                    <p>Eingahr has been observed to be resistant to the corrosive properties of Draiharbloom oil and its derivatives, with high quality alloys
                        maintaining their integrity even after decades of regular contact. Additionally, it is capable of heavily reducing the leakage of magical energy
                        from inundated materials (such as Draiharbloom oil) back into the ambient field. For these reasons it is a popular material of choice for
                        many standard magical tools and storage devices, as well as machinery involved in processing Draiharbloom oil. However, its insulating property can 
                        inhibit channeling of magical energy from the substances contained within, so some designs may opt from more alternative materials.
