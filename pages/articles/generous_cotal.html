                <h2 id="section1">Description</h2>
                    <p>Generous cotals are by far the largest species of cotal, distinguished by its expansive disc-shaped inflorescence.</p>

                    <h3 id="subsection1.1">Leaves</h3>
                        <p>The leaves of the generous cotal are broad, averaging around 18cm in length and 14cm in width, and are dark green in color. The leaves grow in a rosette pattern at the base of the plant. The surface of the leaf is covered in fine, hair-like structures.</p>
 
                    <h3 id="subsection1.2">Flowers</h3>
                        <p>The florets of the generous cotal form a single large, disc-shaped inflorescence that can reach a radius of 50cm. Each individual floret is a small, stiff and glossy, curved in such away that the flower takes on a slightly concave shape ideal for directing sunlight. These florets are arranged in a spiral pattern, radiating outwards from the central core.</p>

                    <h3 id="subsection1.3">Roots</h3>
                        <p>The roots of the generous cotal are thin and fibrous, spreading widely so as to anchor the plant to rocky surfaces and cliffs. They often fuse with the roots of neighboring plants, forming a network that allows for the sharing of nutrients and reponses to external stimuli.</p>
                
                <h2 id="section2">Solar Deterent</h2>
                    <p>The term “generous” reflects the plant's unique cooperative nature. Other cotal species are known to interconnect their roots, sharing nutrients, but the generous cotal takes this a step further by adjusting the orientation of its bloom. The florets are highly reflective and can act as mirrors, directing sunlight toward neighboring plants to support weaker members of the colony. These adjustments usually occur over the course of 1-2 hours</p>
                    <p>In large colonies, groups of generous cotals can position their blooms in such a way that they focus intense sunlight onto nearby competing plants. The concentrated sunlight can quickly cause wilting. This behavior contributes to its success as a pioneer species in harsh, open landscapes.</p>

                <h2 id="section2">Distribution and habitat</h2>
                    <p>Like other cotals, the generous cotal is a “pioneer plant,” thriving on bare, rocky surfaces left behind by landslides and glaciers, as well as on cliffs and pinnacles.</p>
                    <p>Generous cotals are native to the dry, rocky landscape of northwestern Ekhala.</p>

                <h2 id="section3">Uses</h2>
                   <p>The flowers of generous cotals are edible and nutritious when cooked and they are often eaten whole. When grilled, they take on a crunchy texture and savory flavor. The leaves are also edible, though the hairs cause irritation and must be removed before cooking, as they easily ignite. In central Tir Moran, they are traditionally grilled and drizzled with a sauce made from the brownberry eye mushroom.</p>
                   <p>Generous cotals are cultivated extensively along the Eyrf Eylf river's westward bank for food.</p>
                   <p>It is possible to use large gardens of generous cotal as a deterent for pests, though this method carries significant risks of unintended fires.</p>
