                <h2 id="section1">Description</h2>
                    <p>Brownberry eyes are small, cup-shaped mushrooms that parasitize the trunks and branches of several related tree species. The fruiting bodies have a gelatinous brown texture. Their coloration darkens toward the center of their cap, causing them to resemble tiny eyes. When touched, these mushrooms respond by closing their "cups" and secreting a tannin-rich liquid. This chemical defense is derived from the tannins of the host tree as a way to deter insects and grazing herbivores.</p>
                    <p>When exposed to heat, they will also eject their spores as a means of ensuring the survial of another generation, closing indefinitely.</p>

                <h2 id="section2">Distribution and Habitat</h2>
                    <p>Brownberry eyes are commonly found in the temperate forests of Ekhala along with their host trees. The mushrooms thrive in cool, shaded environments with low to moderate humidity.</p>

                <h2 id="section3">Uses</h2>
                   <p>Brownberry eyes are frequenly cultivated in regions with cool climates. Due to their sensitivity to heat, they are generally not harvested during the warmer months. Their tannins can be easily extracted by soaking them in warm water, then used for tanning.</p>
                   <p>The soaked mushroom can be eaten as well, though it maintains a bitter taste and slimy texture. More often, small amounts of the soaked mushroom are ground and mixed with other ingredients, forming various sauces.</p>
                   <p>Whole, unsoaked mushrooms can be eaten in small amounts, inducing a sense of calm along with decreased focus and capacity for reasoning.</p>
