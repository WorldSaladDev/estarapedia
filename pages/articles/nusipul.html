                    <p>The highland nusipul is a pink-flowered plant occurring around mountain springs and streams, where dense thickets of nusipul reduce the waterflow and create gentle wetlands known as “nusipul tubs.”</p>

                    <h3 id="subsection1.1">Stalk</h3>
                        <p>The stalks of the highland nusipul grow to extend just above the surface of the water, though the plant usually reaches no more than 1-2 meters in total height above ground, so that they can flower above-water. Below water, the stalks are covered in a waxy skin, preventing excess water absorption. Above the water, the stalks are hairy, allowing bubbles formed by their "soap" to stick to them easily.</p>
 
                    <h3 id="subsection1.2">Flowers</h3>
                        <p>Highland nusipul flowers are tall, with clusters of delicate pink blossoms that emit a viscous secretion refered to as "nusipal soap." The flowers have numerous thin petals that fan out with space in between them, ensuring maximal surface area for the soap to collect on.</p>

                    <h3 id="subsection1.3">Corm</h3>
                        <p>The nusipul plant's corms are bulbous, starchy storage organs located just below the surface of river sediments. They are bumpy and roughly spherical, about 8-12cm in diameter, and are covered in a thin, fibrous skin that protects them from damage and waterlogging in their wet habitat.</p>
                        <p>The highland nusipul's corm is particularly rich in starch and nutrients compared to its relatives. These corms critical to the plan's survival strategy, enabling it to endure the harsh winters and regrow each spring. During the dormant winter months, the corms store the energy needed for the plant to regrow rapidly once the snow melts. This adaptation ensures that highland nusipul plants can thrive in their seasonal environment despite limited growing periods.</p>
                
                <h2 id="section2">Reproduction and Seasonal Cycle</h2>
                    <p>Nusipal soap serves both a reproductive and defensive purpose. When wind speeds are high enough, the soap accumulated on the flowers forms bubbles that carry the plant's tiny, dust-like spores, dispersing them across a wide area. Some of the spores remain at the same location to continue the life of the colony.</p>
                    <p>As harsh winter months settle over the mountainous regions where the highland nusipul thrives, the stalk and flowers wither and die. This process begins as temperatures drop, causing the plant to withdraw its remaining nutrients and energy reserves into its corms. The decaying upper portions break down in the soil, enriching the immediate area to promote future growth.</p>
                    <p>Once the plant is buried under snow, the corm enters a state of dormancy, preserving its stored energy through the cold season. The snow acts as both an insulator and a protective barrier, shielding the corm from extreme cold and physical damage.</p>
                    <p>When the snow begins to melt with the arrival of spring, the nusipul corms reactivate, rapidly regrowing their stalks and flowers. This quick regeneration allows the plant to reestablish dense colonies within a matter of weeks, taking full advantage of the short growing season.</p>

                <h2 id="section2">Distribution and habitat</h2>
                    <p>The highland nusipal thrives around natural springs in the cold northern foothills of Ekhala, and can also be found in shallow depressions in mountain ranges where snow melt pools.</p>

                <h2 id="section3">Uses</h2>
                   <p>Artificial highland nusipal tubs are cultivated by some populations in the colder regions of Tir Moran near where the Eyrf Eylf river flows out of the Eyrf Ofeyn forest. They have a mildly bitter, chemical taste that tends to be unpopular elsewhere.</p>
                   <p>The stalks of the plant can be peeled and dried to be used in fiber cordage.</p>
