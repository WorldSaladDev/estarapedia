                <h2 id="section1">Etymology</h2>
                    <p>The name "aiaithyar" (Temric: <em>"Bliss Flower"</em>) comes from its flower-like shape and euphoric properties.</p> 

                <h2 id="section2">Description</h2>
                    <p>Aiaithyar is a small, flower-shaped mushroom native to shaded forest environments. Typically measuring 1-2 centimeters in height and 1 centimeter in diameter, it has a delicate, cream-colored cap that transitions to a soft yellow toward the center.</p>

                <h2 id="section3">Reproduction</h2>
                    <p>Aiaithyar can remain dormant for years at a time, and only fruit to release spores for a short period after the end of heavy rainfall, making them difficult to collect.</p>

                <h2 id="section4">Distribution and Habitat</h2>
                    <p>Aiaithyar are native to the Berrath Steppe, but their spores have been spread throughout the world by humans. They grow with relative success anywhere that recieves heavy rainfall at least once every few years.</p>

                <h2 id="section5">Uses</h2>
                    <p>Aiaithyar has a flavor described as an exquisite blend of nutty and savory tones, with a faint, honey-like sweetness that lingers on the palate.</p>
                    <p>Beyond its taste, the aiaithyar is prized for its mild euphoric effects, which induce a sense of relaxation, warmth, and heightened sensory perception. Its effects are subtle, enhancing the mood without impairing judgment. These properties make it a favorite ingredient among chefs and herbalists alike.</p>
            
                <h2 id="section6">Aitzek's Cataclysm Misidentification</h2>
                    <p>Aitzek's cataclysm is a mushroom that appears identical to the aiaithyar, but rather than inducing euphoria, it creates hallucinations of apocalyptic events.
                    <p>Since the discovery of Aitzek's cataclysm, usage of aiaithyar has declined significantly.</p>
                    <p>Wealthy individuals sometimes employ tasters to verify whether a specimen is indeed an aiaithyar and not aitzek's cataclysm.</p>
