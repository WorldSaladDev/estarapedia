                <h2 id="section1">Description</h2>
                    <p>The kyryar plant is an evergreen shrub growing to between 0.2 and 0.5 meters in height. They grow individually or in small clusters.</p>
                    <p>Kyryar shrubs typically live 10 to 20 years in the wild, and are exceptionally difficult to cultivate, especially outside their native range.</p>

                    <h3 id="subsection1.1">Stem</h3>
                        <p>The stem of the kyryar plant is woody with thick, scaly green-brown bark. The stem at the root of the plant typically reaches around 17 centimeters in diameter and thins out toward the foliage, branching frequently.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="subsection1.2">Foliage</h3>
                        <p>The kyryar plant has leaves measuring 3-4 centimeters at their widest and 9-10 centimeters long, tapering to a sharp point at their end. The leaves are dark green in color, and curve downward. They grow from the ends of branches in fans of eight parallel leaves.</p>
                        <p>The plant flowers during warm, humid seasons. Its flowers have eight deep blue petals and measure 10 centimeters in diameter when pressed flat. The petals are relatively thick and oily in texture. The flowers bear small, blue fruit.</p>
                
                <h2 id="section2">Distribution and Habitat</h2>
                    <div class="inline-image-container">

						<figcaption>Distribution of the kyryar plant.</figcaption>
					</div>
                    <p>The kyryar plant thrives in high elevations on the mountains of Ekhala and parts of the Eyrf Ovfeyn forest in damp, cold soil. It is believed that its growth is somehow influenced heavily by ambient kyr fields, making it difficult to cultivate.</p>
                <h2 id="section3">Uses</h2>
                    <p>A number of uses have been discovered for parts of the plant.</p>
                        <h3 id="subsection3.1">Flowers</h3>
                    <p>The flowers of the kyryar plant are a valuable resource throughout Estara. The plant is primarily harvested so that oils can be extracted from the flowers. This is done by heating and pressing the petals, resulting in a viscous dark blue oil. Refined kyryar oil is corrosive to metal and flesh, but holds comparatively large quantities of ambient energy for its volume, making it ideal for magical batteries.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="subsection3.2">Leaves</h3>
                        <p>The leaves of the kyryar plant contain a mild toxin that causes itchiness and rashes when touched, but become safely edible when boiled and dried. The processed leaves are sometimes used in teas.</p>
