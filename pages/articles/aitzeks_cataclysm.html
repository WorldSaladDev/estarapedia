                    <p>Aitzek's cataclysm, also known as "God's Trap" is a mushroom created by the deity Aitzek to trick those who seek to consume aiaithyars. It induces hallucinations of apocalyptic events. Aitzek's cataclysm appears identical to the aiaithyar, and grows in the same conditions, sometimes even appearing in the same colony.</p>

                    <p>Aitzek's cataclysm, as its name suggests, was created by the deity Aitzek for the sole purpose of inflicting suffering on those who seek the euphoria and exalted taste of the aiaithyar mushroom, for his own amusement.</p>

                <h2 id="section2">Properties</h2>
                    <p>When consumed, Aitzek's cataclysm induces visions of apocalyptic events in the user. It has been reported that these hallucinations can feel like they last anywhere from hours to weeks, though in reality the effect typically only lasts a few minutes.</p>
                    <p>Since the discovery of Aitzek's cataclysm, usage of aiaithyar has declined significantly.</p>
