                    </div>
                    <p>A mature weylerrn grows to a height of 7-9m, and the trunk reaches a diameter of 1-1.5m. The trunk begins branching rapidly and irregularly at a height of about 4m. The canopy takes on an irregular spherical shape.</p>
                    <p>The leaves have a wide spearhead shape with a single central vein. They are 3-5cm wide at their widest and 5-8cm long, tapering at the end. Leaves occur in four alternating whorls of five leaves at the ends of branches, just before a cluster of five fruit-bearing branches. The leaves of the last two whorls are progressively smaller than the first two.</p>
                    <p>The fruit are small, curved and elongated, with a length of 3cm and a diameter of 0.5cm. Individual fruit grow from small, iregular branches that branch from a node just after the final whorl of leaves on a branch.</p>
                    <p>Weylerrn trees possess both aerial and subteranean roots that spread irregularly. The above-ground roots grow thin projections along the ground that reabsorb nutrients from ground cover like fallen leaves.</p>
                    <p>The waylearn absorbs both mineral and organic toxins to secrete a faintly yellow substance from its roots, which quickly crystalizes on contact with air. Below ground, this substance saturates the soil around the tree's roots, making it inhospitable to most other plant life. Brief skin contact with the substance causes a numbing sensation, but heavy inundation can lead to paralysis, detering creatures from preying upon the plant. Thus, the weylerrn thrives in very poor soil where other plants cannot.</p>

                    <p>Weylerrns grow in groves alongside the permafrost shrub in mixed forests across the Berrath steppe and the southern edge of the Eyrf Ofeyn forest.</p>
                    <p>They are found in highly acidic permafrost soil with little nutrients, as they are well adapted to live in these conditions where other plants cannot. Accordingly, they do poorly in more nutrient-rich environments, where their unique adaptations lead to wasted energy and poor performance against other plants.</p>
                    <p>Weylerrns prefer cold air temperatures, but fare very poorly in temperatures consistently low enough for permafrost to form. Because of this, they are almost always found in temperate environments alongside the permafrost pine. </p>

                <h2 id="section3">Uses</h2>
                    <p>Weylerrns are quite difficult to domesticate. Despite this, the fruit of wild trees are often harvested for food. The fruit have a sour taste and grainy texture that makes them unpleasant to eat raw, but they are often dried and coated in sugar to create candied weylerrn fruit, which are popular throughout northern Ekhala. Because of the prolonged contact with weylerrn roots that harvesters often experience, there is risk of paralysis and subsequent death even with proper equipment. Long-term nerve damage is also common.</p>
                    <p>Weylern root poison can be used as a local anesthetic.</p>
