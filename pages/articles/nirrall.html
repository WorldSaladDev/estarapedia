                <h2 id="section1">Habitat</h2>
                    <p>The Nirrall live in many environments across Estara thanks to different subspecies' specialized adaptations and technological advancements.</p>

                <h2 id="section2">Biology</h2>
                    <h3 id="section2.1">Anatomy</h3>
                        <p>Nirrall are large bipedal or quadrupedal rodents (about 3 feet tall) covered in fur. They share physiology typical of other rodents, in addition to exceptionally large brains.</p>

                    <h3 id="section2.2">Diet</h3>
                        <p>Nirrall are omnivorous and widespread. They consume a variety of food sources depending on the area they live in. Their diet consists largely of farmed crops and livestock.</p>

                    <h3 id="section2.3">Subspecies</h3>
                        <p>There are a number of subspecies of nirrall adapted to various conditions. In hot environments, shorter fur is typical, while in cold environments, longer fur is typical. Fur color varies by environment. For example, Nirrall from areas that are snowy for much of the year often have white fur.</p>

                <h2 id="section3">Psychic Abilities</h2>
                    <p>The nirrall's large brains set them apart from other rodents in terms of intelligence, but they also allow some of them to tune themselves with Estara's Kyr field, unlocking a variety of psychic abilities. The most common manifestations of this ability are telekenesis, medium-range telepathy, thought-reading, augury, and heat manipulation.</p>

                <h2 id="section4">Culture</h2>
                    <p>Nirrall culture varies widely across Estara, from small groups traveling nomadically in family units to large cities with populations in the tens of thousands. Others still decide to integrate with human cities.</p>
