					<p>Rey is an F5.8V-class main sequence star that lies at the center of the Rey system. The star formed approximately 3.9 billion years ago, and will remain in the main sequence for another 1.7 billion years. It has a mass of 2.4x10<sup>30</sup>kg, a radius of 7.76x10<sup>5</sup>km, and a density of 1229kg/m<sup>3</sup>. It has a surface temperature of 6623K. The star has a habitable zone ranging from 1.39AU to 2.01AU.</p>
					<p>Rey is composed of 73% hydrogen, 23% helium, and 4% heavier elements.</p>
					<p>The Rey system is situated on the inner edge of the ring of a small ring galaxy called the Great Ring. It orbits the center of the galaxy at a distance of 9150ly. The Great Ring is one of many small satellite galaxies orbiting a much larger galaxy in a structure called the Galactic Sigil.</p>
					<p>Rey's stellar neighborhood (defined here as a spherical region 10ly in radius centered on Rey) contains 26 other stellar mass objects in 15 star systems: 1 G-class star, 2 K-class stars, 13 M-class stars, 2 white dwarfs and 8 brown dwarfs. There are 8 single star systems, 6 binary systems, 1 trinary system, and 1 quaternary system.</p>
					<p>To the right is a map of Rey's stellar neighborhood. Star systems are in red, labeled alphabetically in order of their distance from Rey. Their distances are listed in the table below.</p>

				<h2>Orbiting Bodies</h2>
					<p>Orbiting Rey are six major planets, three major dwarf planets, and two debris disks. From innermost to outermost orbit, these objects are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Efeksa, a small, rocky planet without a significant atmosphere and no moons. It orbits at a radius of 1.15AU.</li>
						<li>Estara, a small, life-supporting rocky planet with two small moons. The planet’s surface is mostly covered in liquid water oceans. It orbits at a radius of 1.45AU.</li>
						<li>Rumenak, a life-supporting rocky planet with short days at the outer edge of the habitable zone. It has fewer liquid oceans than Estara and is slightly larger, and has one moon. It orbits at a radius of 1.70AU.</li>
						<li>The inner debris disk is situated between 2.60-4.40AU.</li>
						<li>Teyvoth, a large rocky planet. It orbits at a radius of 5.57AU. It has one moon.</li>
						<li>Karrn, a blue gas giant. It orbits at a radius of 9.98AU. It has numerous moons.</li>
						<li>Yeras, a green gas giant. It orbits at a radius of 18.81AU. It has numerous moons.</li>
						<li>Allteyrv, a dwarf planet. It orbits at a radius of 24.62AU.</li>
						<li>The outer debris disk is situated between 24.65-29.86AU.</li>
						<li>Isai, a dwarf planet. It orbits at a radius of 29.54AU.</li>
						<li>Sōtoth, a large dwarf planet that orbits notably far from the star, at a radius of 36.48AU.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>There are numerous other objects orbiting Rey, including smaller dwarf planets, though none of these are massive enough to be spherical.</p>
