                <h2 id="section1">Geography</h2>
                        <p>Dreiczel is located where the Eyrfeyllf river feeds into the Dreic sea. The surrounding plains are temperate, hilly, and sparsely wooded</p>
                    <h2 id="section2">History</h2>
                        <p>Dreiczel was almost entirely destroyed near the end of the 51Y.E. Temchael civil war in order to eliminate resources that would have been gained by the Tir Moran resistance. It has since been partially rebuilt in the same location due to the favorable geography, and has become the capital city of Tir Moran. Since the war, rebuilding efforts have scavenged what remained of the old city in an effort to recover expensive materials like stone for new construction. As of 100Y.E. most of the city center has been rebuilt, but thousands of structures outside the city walls remain in ruin. These ruins have been designated Lothzel (lit. "past city") district.
                        </p>
