                <h2 id="section1">Description</h2>
                    <p>The frilly elstcoff is a deciduous tree that reaches a height of around 6 meters.</p>
                    <p>The trees are believed to live for around 120 years.</p>

                    <h3 id="subsection1.1">Trunk</h3>
                        <p>The frilly eltscoff has a straight trunk that reaches up to 4 meters tall before branching. Measuring about 30 centimeters in diameter, the trunk is slender but sturdy, covered in smooth, pale bark that darkens with age.</p>
                        <p>At the 4-meter mark, the trunk begins to breanch, spreading outward in all directions. These branches form an irregular, broad canopy. Branches bearing leaves have a slight downward droop.</p>
                    
                    <h3 id="subsection1.2">Foliage</h3>
                        <p>The leaves of the frilly eltscoff are elongated and serrated, typically measuring 18–20 centimeters in length. Their sharp edges are thought to serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores, although no native grazers in the tree’s habitat can reach its branches. The leaves are coated in a waxy layer that helps retain moisture and gives them a glossy appearance.</p>

                    <h3 id="subsection1.3">Flowers</h3>
                        <p>Seasonally, the frilly eltscoff produces vibrant, frilly pink flowers that are among its most distinctive features, giving the tree its name. The petals of the flower are interspersed with sharp white spines.</p>
                        <p>While the spines and serated leaves are believed to deter grazers, the lack of herbivores capable of reaching the tree’s flowers suggests this adaptation may have evolved for another purpose or in response to past ecological pressures.</p>

                    <h3 id="subsection1.4">Roots</h3>
                        <p>The frilly eltscoff has a network of tuberous roots. While they otherwise appear to be safe to eat, the raw roots contain a sedative that can cause an adult human to fall unconscious within minutes of taking a single bite. Heat seems to only strengthen the effect.</p>
            
                <h2 id="section2">Distribution and Habitat</h2>
                    <p>The frilly eltscoff is native to northern Ekhala. It is found commonly in the southern edge of the Eyrf Ovfeyn forest. It can also be found in grasslands throughout northern Ekhala.</p>

                <h2 id="section3">Uses</h2>
                    <p>The roots of the frilly eltscoff are often utilized for their sedative properties in both remedies and poisons. A common method of extracting the sedative involves heating, grinding and mixing the roots with water to form a paste, then pressing and straining the paste to collect the resulting liquid. The dried paste is also more safely consumable, usually only resulting in mild tiredness.</p>
