                    <p>Eingahr is a metal alloy with similar composition to cupronickel. It is used to construct devices for manipulating ambient energy due to its resistance to corrosion from <a href="./kyryar.html">kyryar</a> oil compounds and kyr insulating properties.</p>

                <h2 id="section1">Composition</h2>
                    <p>Eingahr is a metal alloy typically composed of majority copper, with the addition of nickel and zinc. Throughout the forging process, kyr is directed into the mass of molten metal, modifying the structure.

                    <h3 id="subsection1.1">Alternative Compositions</h3>
                        <p>Alternative compositions have been tested with varying results. It has been reported that a higher percentage of nickel content can increase resistance to corrosion, at the cost of reduced maleability.</p>
                <h2 id="section2">Properties</h2>
                    <p>Eingahr has been observed to be resistant to the corrosive properties of Draihar oil and its derivatives, with high quality alloys maintaining their integrity even after decades of regular contact. Additionally, it is capable of heavily reducing the leakage of kyr from energized materials (such as kyryar oil). For these reasons it is a popular material of choice for many standard kyric tools and storage devices, as well as machinery involved in processing kyryar oil. However, its insulating property can inhibit channeling of kyr from the substances contained within, so some designs may opt for alternative materials.</p>
