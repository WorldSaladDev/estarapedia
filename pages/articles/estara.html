					<p>Estara has four major landmasses: Ekhala, Tzizen, Anka and Estica. Estaran maps typically center on the Mouth of Estara, a large and persistent circular storm centered near the equator.</p>
					<p>The planet is commonly divided into northern and southern hemispheres around the equator, as well as eastern and western hemispheres through the center of the Mouth of Estara.</p>

						</div>
						
						<h3 id="subsection2.1">Humans</h3>
							<p>The Hamshi nation occupies the southwestern portion of Ekhala, including most of the Dunes of Ekhala. They primarily speak the <a href="./hamshi_language.html">Hamshi language</a>.</p>
							<p>The Primetira Kingdom occupies the southeastern portion of mainland Ekhala, and control colonies in their territory on eastern Anka. They primarily speak Primatiran.</p>
							<p>Temchael occupies northeastern Ekhala, including the Bay of Temchael, which they are named for, and surrounding lands. Their primary language is Temric.</p>
							<p>The Republic of Tir Moran occupies northern Ekhala. They are the newest nation on Estara, having broken away from Temchael in a civil war and officially declaring themselves an independent nation in 70YE.</p>
							<p>The Altueran League are a series of smaller kingdoms inhabiting the Altueran Islands south of Ekhala. They are a series of self-governing city states. The people primarily speak a local variation of Primetiran. They also have small colonies in western Estica.</p>
							<p>Jozao occupies the southern part of Tzizen and the interior of the mountain valley, as well as the Jyan peninsula.</p>
							<p>Yonjiang occupies the northern part of Tzizen, as well as the Jyan Island Chain and the outer Tzizen islands.</p>
							<p>Tamzo is an independent island nation east of Tzizen.</p>
							<p>Tesh occupies most of Anka, with the exception of the forest of Melar, and the peninsula of Volare. They are under active conflict with the Primetira Kingdom over control of the peninsula of Volare. They primarily speak Teshtan.</p>
							<p>The Melar Kingdom is a feudal country that control Estica and the forest of Melar. Their primary language is Melarian.</p>
							<p>Regania is an island nation located west of the Melar Sound. The country was established in -34 YE after the colonies of Regania broke away from the Primetira Kingdom.</p>
						
							<h3 id="subsection2.2">Nyrall</h3>
							<p class="subtext">Main article: <a href="./nirrall.html">Nyrall</a></p>
							<p>The Nirrall are a race of intelligent rodents that are spread across Estara. Like humans, their cultures vary greatly from place to place, from nomadic tribes to large cities.</p>
						
							<h3 id="subsection2.3">Shull</h3>
							<p class="subtext">Main article: <a href="./shull.html">Shull</a> </p>
							<p>The shull are a race of intelligent humanoid mollusks that inhabit the sea of Cciborne and nearby coastal waters around Anka. Because shull populations are small and physiologically restricted to the sea,  there is little reason for conflict with terrestrial civilizations. Shull have however been known to conduct limited trade with coastal terrestrial communities, with communication being conducted through writing. Little is known about their culture.</p>
					
					<h2 id="section3">Timekeeping</h2>
						<p>One Estaran day is equal to 24 hours. An Estaran year lasts 240 days. The calendar is split into ten months, each with three weeks lasting eight days.</p>
						<p>In many cultures across Estara, it is believed that one transitions to adulthood at the age of twenty-four years, with many cultures having a rite of passage at this age. The number twenty-four is of special interest because of its connection with the cycles of Estara and its moons.</p>
						<p>The the Primetiran Calendar is agreed upon by most major governments on Estara in order to better facilitate trade. 1YE falls on the year the Primetiran Calendar was devised. The kingdoms of Tesh and Melar each use their own calendar systems. </p>

						</div>
						<p>Estara has two orbiting moons.</p>
						<h3 if="section4.1">Ephelion</h3>
							<p class="subtext">Main article: </p>
							<p>Ephelion is the closer of Estara's two moons. It has a rocky surface and a dark, slightly purple appearance. It has an angular size of approximately 0.555 degrees when viewed from Estara. Ephelion orbits Estara once every 8 days, influencing the 8-day weeks of the Primetiran calendar scheme.</p>
						<h3 if="section4.2">Acies</h3>
							<p class="subtext">Main article: </p>
							<p>Acies is the further of Estara's two moons. It has a rocky surface with a reddish appearance. It is larger than Ephelion, but is further away from Estara, thus it has a smaller angular size of approximately 0.3 degrees when viewed from Estara. Acies orbits Estara once every 24 days, influencing the 24-day months of the Primetiran calendar scheme.</p>
