						<p>Estara is the second closest planet to Rey, orbiting at an average distance of 1.43au (2.14*10^8km) with minimal eccentricity. The planet has a mass of 3.36*10^24kg and a radius of 4783km. It has an axial tilt of 31.5 degrees. Oceans of liquid water cover 83% of the planet's surface. It has a total land area of 4.88*10^7km^2, 17% of the planet's surface. The gravitational acceleration at the planet's surface is about 9.81m/s^2. It is one of four terrestrial planets in the Rey star system, and one of two that harbors life, the other being Rumenak.</p>
						<p>Estara's large oceans and axial tilt contribute to highly variable climates and biodiversity.</p>

						<h3 id="subsection1.1">Geography</h3>
							<p>Estara has four major landmasses: Ekhala, Tzizen, Karaina, Anka and Estica, all of which are inhabited.</p>
							<p>The planet is commonly divided into northern and southern hemispheres around the equator, as well as eastern and western hemispheres through the center of the Mouth of Estara.</p>

					<h2 id="section2">Civilization</h2>

						</div>
						
						<h3 id="subsection2.1">Humans</h3>
							<p>There are numerous human cultures and civilizations spread across Estara.</p>
						
							<h3 id="subsection2.2">Nirall</h3>
							<p class="subtext">Main article: <a href="./nirrall.html">Nirall</a></p>
							<p>The Nirrall are a race of intelligent rodents that are spread across Estara. Like humans, their cultures vary greatly from place to place, from nomadic tribes to large cities.</p>
						
							<h3 id="subsection2.3">Shull</h3>
							<p class="subtext">Main article: <a href="./shull.html">Shull</a> </p>
							<p>The shull are a race of intelligent humanoid mollusks that inhabit the sea of Cciborne and nearby coastal waters around Anka. Because shull populations are small and physiologically restricted to the sea,  there is little reason for conflict with terrestrial civilizations. Shull have however been known to conduct limited trade with coastal terrestrial communities, with communication being conducted through writing. Little is known about their culture.</p>
					
					<h2 id="section3">Timekeeping</h2>
						<p>One Estaran day is equal to 24 hours. An Estaran year lasts 240 days. The calendar is split into ten months, each with three weeks lasting eight days.</p>
						<p>In many cultures across Estara, it is believed that one transitions to adulthood at the age of twenty-four years, with many cultures having a rite of passage at this age. The number twenty-four is of special interest because of its connection with the cycles of Estara and its moons.</p>
						<p>The the Primetiran Calendar is agreed upon by most major governments on Estara in order to better facilitate trade. 1YE falls on the year the Primetiran Calendar was devised. The kingdoms of Tesh and Melar each use their own calendar systems. </p>
					
					<h2 id="section4">Moons</h2>

						</div>
						<p>Estara has two orbiting moons.</p>
						<h3 if="section4.1">Ephelion</h3>
							<p class="subtext">Main article: </p>
							<p>Ephelion is the closer of Estara's two moons. It has a rocky surface and a dark, slightly purple appearance. It has an angular size of approximately 0.555 degrees when viewed from Estara. Ephelion orbits Estara once every 8 days, influencing the 8-day weeks of the Primetiran calendar scheme.</p>
						<h3 if="section4.2">Acies</h3>
							<p class="subtext">Main article: </p>
							<p>Acies is the further of Estara's two moons. It has a rocky surface with a reddish appearance. It is larger than Ephelion, but is further away from Estara, thus it has a smaller angular size of approximately 0.3 degrees when viewed from Estara. Acies orbits Estara once every 24 days, influencing the 24-day months of the Primetiran calendar scheme.</p>
