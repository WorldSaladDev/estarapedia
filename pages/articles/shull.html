                    <p>The shull are an intelligent humanoid race resembling mollusks that live in bodies of salt water. They primarily inhabit the Sea of Ciborne.</p>

                <h2 id="section1">Habitat</h2>
                    <p>Communities of shull are found throughout the sea of Cciborne and nearby coastal waters around eastern Anka. They tend to live in dwellings between 10 and 100 meters under the surface of the water. They inhabit houses constructed from various materials, especially rock either gathered as whole stones or carved using tools.</p>
                <h2 id="section2">Biology</h2>
                    <h3 id="section2.1">Anatomy</h3>
                        <p>Shull anatomy is poorly understood. They have a vaguely humanoid form and, being related to sea snails, stand upright on a single foot muscle, with the eyes and mouth positioned at the top of the body. Shull typically have a number of hard plates running down their backs, presumably for protection, though they also sometimes wear armor. Their bodies require constant moisture, so shull are unable to persist outside of water for extended periods of time.</p>
                    <h3 id="section2.2">Diet</h3>
                        <p>Shull are omnivorous. They practice agriculture and animal husbandry, farming a number of organisms including algae, sea arthropods, mollusks and mammals. They also use traps to capture fish. They also rarely venture onto shores and harvest terrestrial plants and animals.</p>
                <h2 id="section3">Culture and Trade</h2>
                    <p>Little is known about shull culture. There are numerous regional shull languages, and they can learn new languages, including writing in the terrestrial languages, though their physiology prevents them from speaking these languages effectively. Shull have relgious practices that vary by community. Many shull cultures have extensive written traditions using stone carvings.</p>
