                        <p>Eingahr is a metal alloy with similar composition to cupronickel. It is used to construct

                    <h2 id="section1">Composition</h2>
                    <p>Eingahr is a metal alloy typically composed of majority copper, with the addition of nickel and zinc.
                        Throughout the forging process, ambient energy is directed into the mass of molten metal.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="subsection1.1">Alternative Compositions</h3>
                    <p>Alternative compositions have been tested with varying results. It has been reported that a higher percentage of nickel content can 
                        increase resistance to corrosion, at the cost of reduced maleability.
                    </p>
                    <p>The properties and qualities of Eingahr can vary slightly depending on where it was forged and where the materials were sources. It is 
                        speculated that variations in the ambient field at different locations can affect the outcome of the forging process.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="section2">Properties</h2>
                    <p>Eingahr has been observed to be resistant to the corrosive properties of Draihar oil and its derivatives, with high quality alloys
                        maintaining their integrity even after decades of regular contact. Additionally, it is capable of heavily reducing the leakage of ambient energy
                        from energized materials (such as Draihar oil) back into the ambient field. For these reasons it is a popular material of choice for
                        many standard mystical tools and storage devices, as well as machinery involved in processing Draihar oil. However, its insulating property can 
                        inhibit channeling of ambient energy from the substances contained within, so some designs may opt from more alternative materials.
