                    <h2 id="section1">Description</h2>
                    <p>The Draihar plant is an evergreen shrub growing 0.2-1 meters in height. They grow in groups that can span large areas.</p>
                    <p>Draihar shrubs typically live 1 to 2 years in the wild, and are exceptionally difficult to cultivate, especially outside their native range.</p>
                    <h3 id="subsection1.1">Stem</h3>
                    <p>The stem of the Draihar plant is woody with thick, scaly green-brown bark. The stem at the root of the plant typically reaches around 17 centimeters in diameter
                        and thins out toward the foliage, branching frequently.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="subsection1.2">Foliage</h3>
                    <p>The Draihar plant has leaves measuring 3-4 centimeters wide and 9-10 centimeters long. The leaves are dark green in color, and curve downward. They grow from the ends of branches
                        in fans of eight parallel leaves.
                    <p>The Draihar plant flowers during warm, humid seasons. Its flowers have eight deep blue petals and measure 10 centimeters in diameter when pressed flat. The petals are relatively thick
                        and oily in texture. The flowers bear small, blue fruit.
                    </p>

					</div>
                    <p>The Draihar plant thrives in high elevations on the mountains of Ekhala and parts of the Umbreweald in damp, cold soil. It is believed that its growth is influenced
                        heavily by the ambient field, making it difficult to cultivate.

                    <h2 id="section3">Uses</h2>
                    <p>A number of uses have been discovered for parts of the plant.</p>
                    <h3 id="subsection3.1">Flowers</h3>
                    <p>The flowers of the Draihar plant are a valuable resource throughout Estara. The plant is primarily harvested so that oils can be extracted from the flowers. This is done by heating and 
                        pressing the petals, resulting in a viscous dark blue oil. Refined Draihar oil is corrosive to metal and flesh, but holds comparatively large quantities of ambient energy for its volume, making it ideal
                        for magical batteries.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="subsection3.2">Leaves</h3>
                    <p>The leaves of the Draihar plant contain a mild toxin that causes itchiness and rashes when touched, but become safely edible when dried. They are often used in teas.</p>
